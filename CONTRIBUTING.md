# 🤝 Contributing to Sovereign Map

Welcome, Analyst. By contributing to this repository, you are helping reclaim the global spatial commons. We operate as a decentralized collective under the SGP framework.

## 📡 How to Contribute

### 1. Spatial Audits
If you have identified a geopolitical anomaly or a heritage site (SGP-001) that requires voxel-anchoring:
* Open a **Spatial Audit Issue**.
* Attach your QSB telemetry or ZK-Proof root hash.
* Tag the issue with the relevant sector ID.

### 2. Code Contributions
We welcome improvements to our simulated ORB-SLAM3 engine and Gemini AI integration:
* **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch (`feature/voxel-optimization`).
* Ensure all TypeScript code follows our high-contrast tactical UI standards.
* **Commit Messages**: Must follow the SGP-001 format (e.g., `audit: update voxel density for sector-7`).

### 3. Governance Proposals
New proposals for the Spatial DAO should be submitted as a Pull Request to the `/proposals` directory following the SGP-XXX template.

## 🛡️ Code of Conduct
* **Privacy First**: Never submit raw geolocation data; only QSB-compressed, ZK-proven spatial bundles are accepted.
* **Neutrality**: Analyst insights must be grounded in verifiable data via the Gemini API.
