# 🌍 Sovereign Map Explorer (v2035.1)

> **"Reclaiming the world's data layer through Decentralized Spatial Intelligence."**

Sovereign Map is a high-fidelity spatial operating system and geopolitical analyst dashboard. It reclaims the spatial commons by merging real-time **ORB-SLAM3** visual tracking with **Google Gemini AI** powered geopolitical intelligence, all anchored to the **Polygon AggLayer** for cryptographic finality.

## 🔭 Vision & Manifesto

In a world where spatial data is increasingly privatized, Sovereign Map proposes a **Global Spatial Commons**. Every "Voxel" scanned and every geopolitical "Insight" generated is a step toward a transparent, verifiable, and decentralized representation of our world.

- **Non-Custodial Perspective**: Prove your physical ownership of a viewpoint without sacrificing location privacy using ZK-Proofs.
- **Sovereign Intelligence**: AI-driven risk assessment that bypasses centralized media narratives.
- **Digital Heritage Sanctuaries**: Protecting global landmarks (SGP-001) from commercial spatial overlays.

## 🛠 Features

### 1. Simulated ORB-SLAM3 Engine
A high-performance monocular-inertial SLAM simulation that visualizes feature tracking, voxel density, and sub-millimeter drift correction. Access via the **"Initiate Spatial Scan"** interface.

### 2. Geopolitical Intelligence (Gemini AI)
Deep integration with Google Gemini 1.5/2.0 models to provide:
- **Sovereign Risk Matrices**: Real-time analysis of political, economic, and social stability.
- **Google Search Grounding**: Every analyst insight is cross-referenced with live web data for maximum accuracy.
- **Interactive Analyst Chat**: Query a dedicated analyst about any global trend.

### 3. AggLayer & ZK-Proofs
Simulated blockchain finality where spatial data is committed as state-roots.
- **ZK-SNARKs**: Cryptographic proof generation for voxel anchoring.
- **QSB (Quantized Spatial Bundles)**: 99% compression for high-speed spatial data streaming.

### 4. Tactical UX
- **D3.js Dynamic Mapping**: Interactive Mercator projection with sector-level telemetry.
- **Node Console**: Real-time stream of network blocks, ZK-prover logs, and system health.
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetics**: A high-contrast, CRT-inspired interface built for elite analysts.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript
- **Visualization**: D3.js, Recharts, TopoJSON
- **Intelligence**: Google Gemini API (@google/genai)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Interactions**: Framer Motion / CSS Animate-in
- **Mapping**: ORB-SLAM3 Logic (Simulated), AggLayer Integration (Simulated)

## 📋 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- An API Key for Google Gemini (configured in `process.env.API_KEY`).
- Browser permissions for **Camera** (for the Spatial Scanner) and **Geolocation** (for Node Telemetry).

### Usage
1. **Initialize Node**: Allow the system to complete the boot sequence and sync with the AggLayer.
2. **Explore the Map**: Click any country to initiate a sovereign risk audit.
3. **Anchor Voxels**: Use the scanner to "claim" your local spatial perspective.
4. **Consult the DAO**: Use the Chat Interface to dive deeper into geopolitical anomalies.

## 📜 Governance

This project operates under the **SGP (Spatial Governance Proposal)** framework. Current active proposal: **SGP-001 (Heritage Sanctuaries)**.
